<h1 class="content"> Lesson 1 : Introduction to CSS </h1><br><br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> CSS or Cascading Style Sheets </h3> <br>
<ul>
    <li> CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. </li> <br>
    <li> CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. </li> <br>
    <li> External stylesheets are stored in CSS files. </li> <br>
    <li> CSS is the language we use to style a Web page. </li> <br>
    <li> CSS separates content from design, making websites easier to maintain and more attractive. </li> <br>
</ul> 

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Why use CSS? </h3> <br>

<ul>
    <li> CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
    </li> <br>
    <li> Provides consistency across web pages. </li> <br>
    <li> Saves time: one CSS file can control multiple pages. </li> <br>
    <li> Improves accessibility and responsiveness. </li> <br>
    <li> Enhances design with layout, colors, and animations. </li>
</ul> <br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Layers of a Webpage </h3> <br><br><br>

<p> Just like how the elements of human body were layered and placed on top of each other to become a whole, the web page, is also composed of layers to make it whole.</p> <br><br><br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Layers of a Webpage </h3> <br>

<ol>
    <li> Behavior Layer </li> <br>
    <li> Presentation Layer </li> <br>
    <li> Content Layer </li>
</ol> <br>

<p> Each layer of the webpage has its specific use or function in the web page. Each plays an important role to be able to attain the goal or objective of a particular website. </p> <br><br><br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Content Layer </h3> <br><br>

<h4> The content layer is where you: </h4>

<ul>
    <li> define and layout the text, images, animation, sound, video and everything you want to put in a web page with the use of tags </li> <br>
    <li> is the underlying HTML code of that page. Just as a house's frame creates a strong foundation upon which the rest of the house is built, a solid foundation of HTML creates a platform upon which a web. </li>
</ul>

<h4> Content Layer needs to have: </h4>

<ul>
    <li> Text that is easy to understand. </li> <br>
    <li> Text that makes sense without a visual representation (wrong example: “click on the links below”) </li>
    <li> Alternative text for every image, sound piece or videothat is content </li> <br>
    <li> Text that is fit for the web (KISS, structured intoheaders, paragraphs and lists) </li> <br>
    <li> Explanations of Acronyms and Abbreviations </li> <br>
    <li> Content images need to be unambiguous for the colorblind and text in images needs to have a sufficient size and contrast. </li> <br>
    <li> Information to the users of changes necessary to her environment (example: “opens in a new window” or “PDF document, 182kb”) </li> 
</ul>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Presentation Layer </h3> <br>

<p> The presentation layer is where you can define how people see your web page in a browser. </p> <br><br><br>

<h4> The presentation layer is where you: </h4>

<ul>
    <li> ensure that text can be zoomed without making the site unusable </li> <br>
    <li> ensure that the interactive elements of the site are easy to find </li> <br>
    <li> ensure that images and foreground and background havenough contrast and are unambiguous to the colorblind </li> <br>
    <li> give the site a consistent navigation </li> <br>
    <li> aid the user through business processes </li> <br>
    <li> separate content into easily understandable units </li> <br>
</ul>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Behavior Layer </h3> <br>

<p> The behavior layer is where you have a real-time useinteraction with the web page. The interaction may be simple validation of input or filling out form or even abig as web-based programs. </p> <br><br><br>

<h4> The behavior layer is where you: </h4>

<ul>
    <li> ensure that all the functionality is available to the useregardless of input device </li> <br>
    <li> make the user experience as easy as possible by cuttindown on options until they are necessary </li> <br>
</ul>

<p> In comparison, HTML is used to create the actual content/foundation of the page and CSS is responsible for the design or style of the website, including the layout, visual effects and background. </p> <br><br><br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Benefits of using CSS </h3> <br>

<h4> CSS saves a lot of work </h4> <br><br><br>

<p> You do not have to code the CSS repeatedly into an HTML file. You just need to write the CSS code once and then reuse the same stylesheet in multiple <br> HTML pages. This saves coding time and space of your hard disk. </p> <br><br><br>

<h4> Easy maintenance </h4> <br><br><br>

<p>  You can control the look and layout of several HTML pages at once. </p> <br><br><br>

<h4> Adding style to webpage makes it more pleasing to the eye. </h4> 

<p> Improve the appearance of a website by allowing you to create a much more stylish website since CSS offers a wide array of expressive style capableness. </p> <br><br><br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Capabilities of CSS </h3> <br><br>

<ol>
    <li> CSS makes your pages easily updateable. CSS makes it possible to update the layout of the entire page quickly. You can specify a style once and you can apply it as many times in your document. </li> <br>
    <li> Position objects on the page. CSS gives you control when placing objects on the page exactly where you want them </li> <br>
    <li> Layer objects on the page. CSS allows you to position objects in three dimensions. </li>
    <li> Create custom tags. CSS allows you to create custom tags to achieve specialized objectives. </li>
</ol> <br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Advantages of using CSS </h3> <br>

<ol>
    <li> Save typing and development time because you have to enter CSS code only once and it can be applied to many HTML scripts. </li> <br>
    <li> Download faster because your browser will download only one file once. </li> <br>
    <li> Faster page loading. </li> <br>
    <li> You can also have multiple link tags in one document. </li> <br>
    <li> Better design flexibility. </li> <br>
    <li> Easier to maintain and update. </li> <br>
    <li> Separation of structure (HTML) and style (CSS). </li>
</ol> <br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-size:30px;"> Capabilities of CSS </h3> <br>

<p> You should have a basic knowledge and understanding of HTML or XHTML to continue learning CSS. </p>

<br><br><br>

<h1 class="content"> Reflection </h1> <br>
<p> This lesson has taught me a lot because CSS was first introduced here. I also learned that a webpage has different kinds of layers, each with a different purpose. <br><br><br>
